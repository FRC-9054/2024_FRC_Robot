# 2024_FRC_Robot
Robot code for 2024 FRC game




/**    VERSION HISTORY
*           First number in the version number should only increase if the overall structure of
*                    the code changes. The code should remain functionally the same. If the
*                   first number changes, there should be no other changes to the code and the
*                    version should be a single number (ie. V2  or V15       not V2.1)
*
*           Second number in the version number should only change if a feature is added to the
*                    code. Removal of a feature (so long as its not the last feature added)
*                    should be treated like a change to the overall structure.
*
*           Third number should change only for bug fixes and minor "cosmetic" changes. Use of
*                    this number should be avoided by only commiting robot code that works
*                    propperly.
